# reglugerdir API

API layer on top of the associated database.

## Installation

`yarn run dev` builds and runs the project on port 3000 by default, and
concurrently starts a watch task that rebuilds when source files change.

All routes can then be accessed under `localhost:3000/api/v1/[route]`

Set `process.env.PORT` to use a different port.

## Running

To be able to run both `api` and `files proxy` project from the same codebase on
Heroku, we need to set the `start` command "dynamically". On Heroku this is set
in the `START_COMMAND` env variable.

Locally this needs to be passed to the `npm start` command:

```bash
START_COMMAND="npm run start-api" npm start
```

## File/image upoads

- `POST /api/v1/file-upload?scope={regulationIdentifier}`  
  Accepts multipart form uploads from the regulations rich-text editor and saves
  them in an S3 bucket and returns the resulting URL

  - Requires `FILE_UPLOAD_KEY_DRAFT` or `FILE_UPLOAD_KEY_PUBLISH` to be sent via
    a `X-APIKey` header to A) accept/deny upload requests (security) and B) to
    select the appropriate folder to upload the files into. (See
    `assertUploadType(req)`)

  - `env.FILE_UPLOAD_KEY_DRAFT`  
    is the API key used by the Regulations-admin system on Ísland.is to upload
    images and documents for regulation drafts, while they're being authored.  
    (While drafting a new regulation the files are uploaded to an
    `/admin-drafts/:scope/` folder.)

  - `env.FILE_UPLOAD_KEY_PUBLISH`  
    is the API key used by Sæmundur's migration/cleanup admin system, to upload
    images for already published published regulations, **and** the api key used
    by the Regulations-admin system uses to publish images/documents when a
    drafted regulation is finally being published.

  - `env.MEDIA_BUCKET_FOLDER`  
    in "dev-mode" this should always be **non-empty** (e.g. `dev/valur`) but
    **must be** empty in production. This variable is used to make sure all
    images/documents we upload during testing/development end up in a separate
    folder that we can purge with a single AWS CLI command, like so:

        aws s3 --profile regulations rm --recursive  s3://island-is-reglugerd-media/dev

- `POST /api/v1/file-upload-urls`  
  This endpoint is used when a new regulation is published. All resources that
  the new regulation points/links to are automatically uploaded to a stable
  storage in an S3 bucket.

  - Requires `FILE_UPLOAD_KEY_PUBLISH` to be sent via a `X-APIKey` header

  - It accepts JSON payload in the form of
    `{ urls: Array<URLString>, regName: RegName }`

  - The endpoint then returns a JSON response of type
    `Array<{ oldUrl: URLString, newUrl: URLString }>`.  
    All the `newUrl`s point to `https://files.reglugerd.is/` (or
    `process.env.DEV_FILE_SERVER`)

  - Incoming URLs that start with `/` are assumed to be relative to
    `https://www.reglugerd.is` (provides sane back-compat with older content)

  - Incoming URLs starting with
    `https://files.reglugerd.is/admin-drafts/:draftscope/:path` are moved to
    `https://files.reglugerd.is/files/:regName/:path`

  - Other oncoming URLs starting with `https://files.reglugerd.is/` are left
    unchanged
